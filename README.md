# Flask Music Player
Simple music player application made with Flask for my Web Programming Class.  
It includes user register and authentication routes, and uses SQLAlchemy and SQLite for storage.  
The app may be viewed in https://flask-music-player.herokuapp.com, but the database won't have persistency.  

You can use the admin credentials to login:  
Username: `admin`  
password: `admin`
